After making changes to the project, update `DOCS.md` in the project root:

1. Open `DOCS.md` at the project root
2. Update the relevant section(s) based on what was changed:
   - New components → add to Architecture table and relevant section
   - New tokens → add to the C4D token table
   - New settings → add to GameSettings reference
   - New scene elements → add to SceneComponents section
   - Pipeline changes → update Converter section
3. Update the "Senast uppdaterad" date at the bottom
